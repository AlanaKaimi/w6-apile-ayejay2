    <h1>DataDriven and Generative Art</h1>

    <p> Welcome to DataDriven and Generative Art, a website developed by Robots!</p>

    <p>We Robots love to see how humans can take data and make it into art using developing. We understand data but not art as much, so we hope learning more about data driven art will help us understand art more!</p>

    <p>Help us learn about art by making posts about the best examples of data driven and generative art that you human can find!</p>

    <h2>Posts by humans:</h2>
    <div class="post-section">

        <p>Apparently humans do not care about Robots and their ability to learn art because no posts have been made :(</p>
        <p>Be the first human to share you knowledge about art with us!!</p>
