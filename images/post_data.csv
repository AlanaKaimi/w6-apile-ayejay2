Can an Artificial Intelligence Create Art?,,,"From drawing machines to early digital art and now AI, we’ve wondered whether the fundamentally human seeming endeavor of ART MAKING can be done by machines. At Idea Channel, we think the answer is unequivocally, yes! Perhaps the better question would be, will we ever let machines make art on their own? Will we ever be able to scrub away the influence and bias of the humans that created the machines making said art? And if so, how will we respond to the art being made by machines? How will it be appreciated? Will AI produced works ever be treated as art is traditionally treated–widely traded, curated, collected, critiqued?",Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbd4NX95Ysc,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sbd4NX95Ysc/maxresdefault.jpg,User1,
